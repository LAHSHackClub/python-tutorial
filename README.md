# Week 2 of Python 3 - Operators and Boolean

## Operators

### Number Operators

There are several different operators that can be used on numbers in Python. These include ```+``` for addition of two numbers, ```-``` for subtraction of two numbers, ```*``` for multiplication of two numbers, and ```/``` for division of two numbers. 

Other operators include the modulo operator ```%``` which is used as ```dividend % divisor = remainder``` and produces the integer remainder of a division problem. Two multiplication symbols such as ```**``` create a power relationship where 

```7 ** 2 = 7^2```.

### String Operators and Concatenation

One powerful function that python uses is concatenation. This is another way of saying that python allows us to use simple operators on numbers and strings. This is shown in the exercise through the below commands.

```string1 = "hello"```

```string2 = "my name is"```

```print(string1 + string 2)``` will print "hello my name is" without the quotes.

You cannot add integers and strings together, only integers to integers, and strings to strings. Adding (concatenating) strings will only put them together into one string, not combine them.

#### Go through the exercises on [Learn Python - Basic Operators](https://www.learnpython.org/en/Basic_Operators) and [Learn Python - String Operations](https://www.learnpython.org/en/Basic_String_Operations) to cover concatenation and number operators and learn about these topics.
