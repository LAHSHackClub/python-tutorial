# Introduction to Python 3
Welcome to the Python 3 Hack Club Course! In this course, you will learn how to code in the Python programming language in the course of one semester. This is a course compiled by Los Altos High School students through various web resources including [Python for Beginners](pythonforbeginners.com) and [Learn Python](learnpython.org). 

## Uses

Python is a general-purpose programming language, which is another way to say that it can be used for nearly everything. Most importantly, it is an interpreted language, which means that the written code is not actually translated to a computer-readable format at runtime. Whereas, most programming languages do this conversion before the program is even run. This type of language is also referred to as a "scripting language" because it was initially meant to be used for trivial projects.
 
The concept of a "scripting language" has changed considerably since its inception, because Python is now used to write large, commercial style applications, instead of just banal ones. This reliance on Python has grown even more so as the internet gained popularity. A large majority of web applications and platforms rely on Python, including Google's search engine, YouTube, and the web-oriented transaction system of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). You know the language must be pretty serious when it's powering a stock exchange system.
 
Python can also be used to process text, display numbers or images, solve scientific equations, and save data. In short, it is used behind the scenes to process a lot of elements you might need or encounter on your device(s) - mobile included. It is also one program used to build applications on the web, such as online games or online productivity tools. 

## Getting Started

You will setup a [repl.it](repl.it) account, do a simple hello-world program, and get introduced to some tools you can use to further your python learning. 

### Getting Repl.it

First, you will need to create your own [repl.it](repl.it) account to use as an IDE or integrated developer environment. An IDE is an online or downloaded tool that developers use to code and compile/interpret the code and then show what the code will do. [repl.it](Repl.it) is an online IDE where you can both code and interpret that Python code and then see whether the code will work. **Please remember to put yourself as a STUDENT when creating an account.** You can choose to use any email you prefer, as long as it is the same email as your GitHub account. (Personal email is preferred)

### Using Repl.it

Open up your [repl.it](repl.it) account and press the blue plus button that says ```new repl```. Search up the Python coding language and select it in the pop-up box. Skip the GitHub repo choice and name the new repl ```test```. A new program in repl.it is also called a repl. We will go over why it is called "repl" later. 

There will be three sections when you open up the new repl. The first column is files, which will allow you to create more than one python file. We will not use this for a while, so you can ignore it. The second column is where you will write your python program and code to run. The last column is the shell, where the inputs for your program will be typed and outputs for your program will be created. It is the environment for a user to interact with your program. 

The shell is also an environment for you to type in one line commands and have them interpreted. It is a code interpreter that interprets each command you enter, after you enter each command. Come to me with any questions about the shell!

### Hello World

Today, you will simply create a simple ```Hello World``` program. To start off, type in the below code into the second column in your test repl.

```print("Hello World")```

After you type in the code, press run. In the shell, you will see the letters "Hello World" show up! You just created your first python program!
