# Week 1 of Python 3 - Python Syntax and Data Types

## Using Repl.it

Open up your [repl.it](repl.it) account and press the blue plus button that says ```new repl```. Search up the Python coding language and select it in the pop-up box. Skip the GitHub repo choice and name the new repl ```test```. A new program in repl.it is also called a repl. We will go over why it is called "repl" later. 

There will be three sections when you open up the new repl. The first column is files, which will allow you to create more than one python file. We will not use this for a while, so you can ignore it. The second column is where you will write your python program and code to run. The last column is the shell, where the inputs for your program will be typed and outputs for your program will be created. It is the environment for a user to interact with your program. 

The shell is also an environment for you to type in one line commands and have them interpreted. It is a code interpreter that interprets each command you enter, after you enter each command. Come to me with any questions about the shell!

## Hello World

Today, you will simply create a simple ```Hello World``` program. To start off, type in the below code into the second column in your test repl.

```print("Hello World")```

After you type in the code, press run. In the shell, you will see the letters "Hello World" show up! You just created your first python program!
