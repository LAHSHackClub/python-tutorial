# Week 1 of Python 3 - Python Syntax and Data Types

## Using Repl.it

Open up your [repl.it](repl.it) account and press the blue plus button that says ```new repl```. Search up the Python coding language and select it in the pop-up box. Skip the GitHub repo choice and name the new repl ```test```. A new program in repl.it is also called a repl. We will go over why it is called "repl" later. 

There will be three sections when you open up the new repl. The first column is files, which will allow you to create more than one python file. We will not use this for a while, so you can ignore it. The second column is where you will write your python program and code to run. The last column is the shell, where the inputs for your program will be typed and outputs for your program will be created. It is the environment for a user to interact with your program. 

The shell is also an environment for you to type in one line commands and have them interpreted. It is a code interpreter that interprets each command you enter, after you enter each command. Come to me with any questions about the shell!

## Hello World

Today, you will simply create a simple ```Hello World``` program. To start off, type in the below code into the second column in your test repl.

```print("Hello World")```

After you type in the code, press run. In the shell, you will see the letters "Hello World" show up! You just created your first python program!

## Variables and Data Types

To learn about python variables and data types, complete the activities at [Learn Python](https://www.learnpython.org/en/Variables_and_Types). It will guide you through everything and will have built in exercises for you to complete.

### Syntax

Python syntax is extremely easy and is best to learn as you go. Remember to put all string values in quotes to show that it is something to be printed. For now, the syntax only concerns the equal sign when assigning variables, the quotes for string values, and the commands.

For example ```myString = "string"```.

## Commands

One of the main commands you can use in python is ```print```. Using the above example, you can print the value of the ```myString``` variable by using the ```print``` command. You do this by using the below line in your code:

```print(myString)```

You can also hard-code any random string value or integer value through the below two commands.

```print("string")``` will print the word "string" without the quotes.

```print(540)``` will print the number 540. 

### Concatenation

One powerful function that python is concatenation. This is another way of saying that python allows us to use simple operators on numbers and strings. This is shown in the exercise through the below commands.

```string1 = "hello"```

```string2 = "my name is"```

```print(string1 + string 2)``` will print "hello my name is" without the quotes.

You cannot add integers and strings together, only integers to integers, and strings to strings. Adding (concatenating) strings will only put them together into one string, not combine them.

#### Good job on your first lesson! We will learn the input commands next week and do our first project!
